### Research Interests
```
1. Cognitive Modeling with Deep Learning
2. NeuroImage and Processing Tools Develop (in Python)
3. Working Memory and Attention
4. Natural Language Processing
```

### Research Experience & Project Outcome

I have the experience and skills of building neural network model, designing psycholoical experiment and analyzing data using various tools. I've led some projects including:
<dl>
<dd>1. Apply machine learning methods to big neuroimage data to explore brain asymmetry</dd>
<dd>2. Use visual search task to explore the relationship between working memory and attention</dd>
<dd>3. Use neural network and transfer learning method to explore brain image segement</dd>
<dd>4. Apply PointNet-related algorithm to develop an accurate TMS system (participant responsible for the deep learning algorithm)</dd>
</dl>
